/**
 * 
 * The Fork/Join Framework
 * 
 * Parallelism is the execution of multiple tasks simultaneously. Fork Join
 * Framework helps with the execution of those tasks in parallel.
 * 
 * Why?
 * 
 * The Fork/Join approach speeds up the execution of a task that can be split
 * into subtasks/small tasks, be executing them in parallel and combining those
 * results.
 * 
 * Limitations
 * 
 * One requirement for using the Fork/Join Framework is that all of the Subtasks
 * must be "completable and independent" of each other to be truly parallel, so
 * not every problem can be solved using this method. In general, the ForkJoin Framework 
 * is to be used by CPU-intensive computations, not IO bound computations, due to the 
 * long wait periods that could happen.
 * 
 * How it works
 * 
 * It uses a divide and conquer approach, dividing a major task into minor
 * subtasks recursively (Fork), until the division limit is reached and the
 * tasks can be solved, to be later combined (Join).
 * 
 * For the execution of those tasks in parallel, the framework will use a thread
 * pool, which has, be default, the same size of the number of processors
 * available for the JVM.
 * 
 * A thread from the pool has it's own double ended queue, for the matter of
 * storing all the tasks that are being executed/to be executed. The double
 * ended queue nature enables inserts or deletes to both the head and last
 * position of the queue.
 * 
 * The work-stealing algorithm is the greatest functionality for the speed up
 * aspect of the ForkJoin Framework. The algorithm balances the workload between
 * threads, allowing the threads that doesn't have any task at the moment to
 * "steal" from last position of a thread's queue that can't process his own
 * last task at the moment. In theory, there will be more task being processed.
 * 
 * Framework architecture overview
 * 
 * - ForkJoinPool: Base class for the pools, used to balance tasks that can be
 * "work-stealed".
 * 
 * - ForkJoinTask: Represents a task to be executed in a ForkJoinPool.
 * 
 * - RecursiveTask: Specialization of ForkJoinTask, holds a result.
 * 
 * - RecursiveAction: Specialization of ForkJoinTask, just process something
 * without yielding a result.
 * 
 * 
 * Workflow
 * 
 * The idea is that you can split bigger tasks into smaller ones, until that the work
 * is small enough to be completed.
 * 
 * the following algorithm describes how to use the ForkJoinFramework correctly.
 * 
 * if (my task is small enough) 
 * 
 * 	  complete my task 
 * 
 * else 
 * 	  split my task into two small tasks 
 * 
 * 	  execute both tasks and wait for the results 
 * 
 *
 * Then do your work based on the result
 *
