/*
 * Pattern: Parallel Divide and Conquer
 * 
 * Motivations: Some kind of tasks, algorithms or flows can be divided 
 * into smaller pieces, which are independently	resolvable, making them fall 
 * into the category of divide and conquer computations. Those properties 
 * allows the execution to be parallel, possible increasing the speed if those 
 * problems were difficult enough to compensate the cost involved in parallelization.
 * 
 * Intent: Make the execution of some computation that uses the divide and conquer 
 * approach parallel, in order to increase performance if the problem difficulty is 
 * enough to overcome the overhead of using threads and coordination. It uses the ForkJoin Framework 
 * to model those problems.
 *
 * Applicability: Divide and conquer computations.
