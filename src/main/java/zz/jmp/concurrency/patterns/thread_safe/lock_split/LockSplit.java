/**
 * Pattern: Lock Split
 * 
 * Motivations: If you have shared, mutable, independent and hot variables, you
 * can increase performance by giving each variable or variable group it's own
 * lock.
 * 
 * Intent: If the variables or variables groups are independent in terms of
 * logic and usage, we guard their state by assigning a lock to which one of
 * then. We protect all paths that interacts with each variable or variable
 * group, creating a thread safe class that is efficiently in term of lock
 * contention and other hazards like race conditions.
 *
 * Applicability: Classes where you have shared, mutable, independent and hot
 * variables or variables groups, where one single lock will be inefficiently.
