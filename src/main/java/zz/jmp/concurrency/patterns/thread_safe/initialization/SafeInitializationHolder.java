/**
 * Pattern: Safe Lazy Initialization
 * 
 * Motivations: Due to the Java Memory Model, some lazy initialization patterns can be unsafe.
 * Apply the Lazy Initialization idiom correctly using the mechanisms provided
 * by the JVM.
 * 
 * Intent: Safe initialize our object using the holder idiom. Memory
 * writes made during static initialization are automatically visible to all
 * threads.
 * 
 * Applicability: Always when you want to initialize an object in a concurrent code
 * execution.
